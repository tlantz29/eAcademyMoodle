PoodLL Recording
========================================
Thanks for downloading PoodLL.

Installation instructions and a video can be found at http://www.poodll.com .

If you are installing this mod separately from the full PoodLL kaboodle,
there should be only one folder "poodllrecording" expanded after you unzip the zip file.
Place this folder into your moodle installation under the [site_root]/question/type folder.

Then login to your site as an administrator and go to your Moodle site's "notifications" page.
Moodle should then guide you through the installation or upgrade of the PoodLL filter. 

Then when you go to create a question you should see a new question type, poodllrecording, in the list.
The question accepts several response types:
1) Video recording (via PoodLL's Red Server tokyo.poodll.com)
2) Audio Recording (via PoodLL's Red Server tokyo.poodll.com)
3) MP3 Recording (doesn't require Red5)
4) Whiteboard (draw pictures, optionally over a background)

*Please be aware that the poodllrecording question relies on the PoodLL Filter being installed, and won't work properly otherwise*

Good luck.
