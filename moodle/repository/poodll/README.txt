PoodLL Repository
========================================
Thanks for downloading PoodLL.

Installation instructions and a video can be found at http://www.poodll.com .

If you are installing this mod separately from the full PoodLL kaboodle,
there should be only one folder "poodll" expanded after you unzip the zip file.
Place this folder into your moodle installation under the [site_root]/repository folder.

Then login to your site as an administrator and go to your Moodle site's "notifications" page. 
Moodle should then guide you through the installation or upgrade of the PoodLL repository. 
Before you can use the repository you will have to set it up. 

Go to: 
"Site Administration->Plugins->Repositories->Manage Repositories" 
and set the PoodLL repository to "enabled and visible". 
Then a "PoodLL" link will appear beneath "Manage Repositories" in the repositories menu. 
From that link create one or more repository instances. There are five types of PoodLL repository instance.
1) Video recording (via PoodLL's Red Server tokyo.poodll.com)
2) Audio Recording (via PoodLL's Red Server tokyo.poodll.com)
3) MP3 Recording (doesn't require Red5)
4) Whiteboard (draw pictures)
5) Snapshot (take photos with webcam)
The repository instances will then show in the file picker and you can use them in your courses.

*Please be aware that the repository relies on the PoodLL Filter being installed, and won't work properly otherwise*

Good luck.
